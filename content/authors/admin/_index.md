I joined <a href="https://irvapp.fbk.eu/">FBK-IRVAPP</a> as Research Fellow in the Fall of 2019. My current primary research interests are social inclusion, micro-firm behaviour and industrial policies, the role of AI in education and other domains (healthcare and risk assessment), and behavioural public policy. I have worked on designing, programming and managing several experiments (field, lab-in-the-field and survey experiments) and surveys in various settings. I am passionate about causal inference, machine learning, programming and open source software.
