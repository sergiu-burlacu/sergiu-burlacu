    abstract = { We conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a summer learning program for vulnerable students across nine cities in Italy (N = 1,038). The program included educational workshops in small groups (88 hours) and personalized tutoring (12 hours). Results indicate positive effects of the program on Italian skills and, albeit weaker, on mathematics. The positive results were most pronounced among primary school students and among students with special needs or from vulnerable environments. Explorative analyses of noncognitive skills provide conflicting insights: An increase in students’ interest in acquiring new competencies suggests potential enduring effects, but the emergence of dissatisfaction with traditional school activities and heightened school-related stress raises concerns about reduced engagement with conventional schooling. }
