abstract: "We investigate the consistency of prosocial behaviors in response to changes in the institutional setting of a lab-in-the-field experiment involving primary school students in El
Salvador. Students play variants of the dictator game allowing the option to take and with
relative unequal initial endowments. We exploit within-subject variation and find that children are sensitive to the widening of the choice-set, with a significant drop in the contributions
when the take option becomes available. Higher cognitive skills are systematically associated
with higher levels of prosociality and lower sensitivity to changes in the choice set. Irrespective
of the initial inequality in the endowment and their cognitive skills levels, children converge to
a similar split of the final payoff. This is consistent with inequality aversion. The relationship
between individual traits in childhood and the degree of consistency of prosocial behaviors
appears to vary depending on the type of institutional change in the dictator game."
