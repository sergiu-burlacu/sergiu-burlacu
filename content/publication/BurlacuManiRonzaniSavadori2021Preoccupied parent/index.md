abstract: "We examine the hypothesis that parents' low investments in children may be a consequence of adverse cognitive effects of poverty: Financial worries preoccupy low-income parents with immediate concerns, reducing their attention to important parenting tasks.  We test this hypothesis in an online experiment studying purchase decisions of UK parents, including their responsiveness to financial subsidies for child development products.  Both low and higher-income parents respond to a subsidy on such products, by spending more of their household budget. However, when primed with financial worries under the same budget, low-income parents alone ignore the subsidy, prioritizing purchase of immediate household needs instead.  This non-responsiveness to subsidies is driven by worried parents farther away from their last payday.  Better alignment of financial subsidies to payday cycles may help achieve more investment and better child outcomes in poorer families."
