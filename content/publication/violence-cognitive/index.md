abstract: "Following a civil war lasting more than a decade, violence in El
Salvador persists at extremely high levels with the
rise of gangs controlling and fighting for territory. High and
unanticipated fluctuations in violent crimes spread a general feeling of fear and panic among the general population, including children, which may impact their cognitive capacities. This paper investigates the impact of recalling violence exposure on cognitive performance among primary school students in El Salvador. Within a lab-in-the-field experiment, primary school students are randomly assigned to recall episodes of violence either before or after taking
cognitive tests. Students assigned to the former condition, show higher performance by 0.23 standard deviations. The
effect size is larger as reported violence exposure increases. The direction and magnitude of results contrast previous
findings from the literature and suggest that responses to violence
are context-specific and might vary with the intensity of the exposure.
In a country plagued by violent crimes, the sharpening of the cognitive
functions observed in this study could be a coping mechanism in the face of adversity."
